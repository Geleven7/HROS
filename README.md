# Dataset Name
HROS

## Dataset Description
A high-resolution OPT-SAR (HROS) benchmark is constructed to support fine-grained OPT-SAR CMRSIR tasks. The dataset comprises 4,000 optical images and 3,100 high-resolution SAR images, with SAR data collected by the AS-01 satellite and annotated by experienced experts.
